            I am learning full stack web development in the hopes of gaining professionalized experience by creating creative and asthetically pleasing websites. I am learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript throughout the process so far and am excited to expand my skillset towards other development frameworks as well. Thank you for showing interest in my profile.

          Akash is a very quick learner and quickly grasps key concepts of Web development as he believes practicing through working on labs is helping his learning.
          He is a natural leader and finds helping others a good and kind gesture that he must continue expressing.

          Working with Akash has been a great experience because he is 
          interested in finding a solution and always goes the extra mile ensuring everything is near perfect. 
          His determination to successfully produce output for required tasks makes him reliable in a team.

          I worked with Akash on one of the projects and he shows team leadership and good character by organizing
          the game plan and delegating tasks so the team is successful. He deems it his responsibility to perfect done tasks even of other members 
          demonstrating care for the individual and team success.
